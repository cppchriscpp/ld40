# Fluffy Space Escape

Fluffy Space Escape is a turn-based puzzle game for the NES.

The year is 2248. You are a rabbit that has been transported into space after a teleporter mishap. You must fight your way through space to find your way home.

A series of teleporters can get you back. These teleporters are powered by gems. However, these gems are extremely heavy! The more gems you have, the slower you are able to move.

Can you get the bunny back to earth before the end?
